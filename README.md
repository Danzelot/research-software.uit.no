# Research software engineering group website

- https://uit-no.github.io/rse/


### How the GitHub Pages part works

The website is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
Note that the `gh-pages` branch is generated on each push/merge to `main`
branch. The branch `gh-pages` should not be manually modified.


### Local preview

- Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
- Serve locally: `$ zola serve`

CSS is using [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/).
