We are starting a RSE group at UiT, following the footsteps of [UK-based
groups](https://society-rse.org/) and the [RSE group at Aalto
University](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/).

Our vision is to put UiT on the map as a place where research groups have
access to best in class RSE services. Over time we wish to attract excellent
staff, research groups, funding, collaborations, and attention.
